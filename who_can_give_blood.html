                Who can give blood?
                Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are
                some basic requirements one need to fulfill in order to become a
                blood donor. Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:

                Age
                You are aged between 18 and 65.

                In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds
                to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and
                hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is
                obtained.
                In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be
                accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The
                upper age limit in some countries are 60.
                Weight
                You weigh at least 50 kg.

                In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh
                at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10%.
                Health
                You must be in good health at the time you donate.

                You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold
                sore, stomach bug or any other infection.

                If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot
                donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure. If the body
                piercing was performed by a registered health professional and
                any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood
                after 12 hours.

                If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must
                wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.

                You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum
                haemoglobin level for blood donation:

                A test will be administered at the donation site. In many
                countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for
                females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.
                Travel
                Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic,
                e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a
                temporary deferral.

                Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors
                with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative
                exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure
                to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
                Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.

                Behaviours
                You must not give blood:

                If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12
                months
                Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently:
                Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)
                Have ever injected recreational drugs.
                In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more
                behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in
                different countries.

                Pregnancy and breastfeeding
                Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many
                months as the duration of the pregnancy.

                It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding.
                Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months
                (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is
                significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition
                from solids or bottle feeding).

                More information on eligibility to donate
                National eligibility guidelines must be followed when people
                donate blood in the blood service in specific countries. To find
                out whether any health conditions, medications, professions or
                travel history to could affect your ability to give blood,
                please search for detailed information in the national/local
                blood services.
